this system uses a microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to sense if there is some one or object outthere
if there is it sends a signal to the camera which captures what it is in front of it and if there is a person it extracts
its face converts to and 128 column vector and  compares it with the database (for example the owners relative) if it is not
known it will send a message to the owner and captured photo of the robber through email to the owner
